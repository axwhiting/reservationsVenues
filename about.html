<!-- Fulton’s Follow is Rachelle’s flagship location, bolstering a 200-person dining room, a private wine cellar, and a rooftop cigar lounge. What happens at Fulton’s Follow, stays at Fulton’s Follow.

Mysterious Matt’s is the most exclusive location Rachelle’s has to offer, featuring a cozy dining room for ten, complete with a champagne vending machine and a gelato bar. A waiver of liability signature is required before entry.

Lauvray’s Lounge is the most traditional luxury experience Rachelle’s has created. Recommended for our clients wanting to impress their guests, with crushed-velvet booths, crystal chandeliers, and an endless supply of Stella Artois, your boss will surely be impressed

Carmichael’s Cabana - because Rachelle’s wouldn't be complete without a tropical getaway, if you can find it that is. The cabana is the most elusive of our locations, hidden away in one of our other establishments. If you can find the golden switch, a bounty of pina-coladas and rattan furniture await you -->
