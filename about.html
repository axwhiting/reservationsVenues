                <div class ="main Description">
                    For Rachelle, being a mother, java wizard, and pun master was simply not enough. Rachelle realized there was a lot of money to be had in hosting all of these networking events she’s been attending. Software networking events always have pizza. Yes. Always. Pizza makes people thirsty, thirsty people want beer, wine, and liquor. Thirsty developers + Rachelle’s libations = PROFIT! It was that very moment that Fulton’s Follow was born!
	It couldn’t stop there though, programmers needed more networking space, with more alcohol and gimmicky features, like a champagne vending machine! Not only could she profit from food and drink, but she also can start charging rental fees for the large space. CHA-CHING$!
	Four establishments later, Rachelle is just barely getting started. The digital networking space is expanding, and no company caters to the need for a luxury zoom meeting. YET. Rachelle’s Digital Dining Emporium coming soon.

<!-- Fulton’s Follow is Rachelle’s flagship location, bolstering a 200-person dining room, a private wine cellar, and a rooftop cigar lounge. What happens at Fulton’s Follow, stays at Fulton’s Follow.

Mysterious Matt’s is the most exclusive location Rachelle’s has to offer, featuring a cozy dining room for ten, complete with a champagne vending machine and a gelato bar. A waiver of liability signature is required before entry.

Lauvray’s Lounge is the most traditional luxury experience Rachelle’s has created. Recommended for our clients wanting to impress their guests, with crushed-velvet booths, crystal chandeliers, and an endless supply of Stella Artois, your boss will surely be impressed

Carmichael’s Cabana - because Rachelle’s wouldn't be complete without a tropical getaway, if you can find it that is. The cabana is the most elusive of our locations, hidden away in one of our other establishments. If you can find the golden switch, a bounty of pina-coladas and rattan furniture await you -->
