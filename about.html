            <div id="rachelle-text">
                Founded in 2022, Rachelle’s is a world-renowned private entertainment group, focusing on private bars and event spaces to serve high-profile clientele. Clients have the luxury of choosing from four different venues to host their meetings, staff parties, celebrations, and more.

            <div id="main-description">
                For Rachelle, being a mother, java wizard, and pun master was simply not enough. Rachelle realized there was a lot of money to be had in hosting all of these networking events she’s been attending. Software networking events always have pizza. Yes. Always. Pizza makes people thirsty, thirsty people want beer, wine, and liquor. Thirsty developers + Rachelle’s libations = PROFIT! It was that very moment that Fulton’s Follow was born!
                It couldn’t stop there though, programmers needed more networking space, with more alcohol and gimmicky features, like a champagne vending machine! Not only could she profit from food and drink, but she also can start charging rental fees for the large space. CHA-CHING$!
                Four establishments later, Rachelle is just barely getting started. The digital networking space is expanding, and no company caters to the need for a luxury zoom meeting. YET. Rachelle’s Digital Dining Emporium coming soon.
